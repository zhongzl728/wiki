# Using a Logic Analyzer ðŸš§

Unlike an oscilloscope, a logic analyzer only measures the voltage levels of digital signals.

The way a logic analyzer measures and analyzes signals is different from an oscilloscope. Instead of measuring analog details, a logic analyzer detects logic threshold levels. It only looks for two logic levels: when the input is above the threshold voltage (threshold), the level is called `high` or `1`; when the level is below the threshold, it is called `low` or `0`. When the logic analyzer samples the input, it outputs `0` or `1` based on the signal level relative to the voltage threshold.
