# Considerations in Software Development

Don't give users too many choices, as it will make them feel exhausted and harm their sense of happiness. 
There should always be only a few options, and they should not be on the same level; there must be a priority weight. If you provide too many options on the same level, it will only make users feel that you can't distinguish which one is more suitable for them.

Create specific user profiles for target groups. When running for president, you need to please the majority; when developing a product, it is enough to please a minority.
