### Port Types

Data:

- **Downstream Facing Port (DFP)**: Host/Downstream hub port. A typical example is the traditional standard Type-A port.
- **Upstream Facing Port (UFP)**: Device/Upstream hub port. A typical example is the traditional standard Type-B port.
- **Dual-Role Port (DRP)**: A port that switches between DFP and UFP ports before a connection event occurs. After the initial connection event, dynamic swapping can be negotiated through the USB Power Delivery protocol.

Power:

- **Pull Current Source/Power Provider**: Pull current of up to 5A at 5V-20V. A typical example is the traditional standard Type-A port.
- **Sinking Current Source/Power Consumer**: Sinking current of up to 5A at 5V-20V. A typical example is the traditional standard Type-B port.

## Pin Definitions

Type-C has male and female connectors, and most of their pins are mirrored.

### CC Pins

The pull-up and pull-down resistors used on the CC pins depend on whether it is a Downstream Facing Port (DFP), an Upstream Facing Port (UFP), or an Electronically Marked/Active Cable. The functionality of insertion/removal detection, orientation detection, and current capability notification must always be achieved through port monitoring.

**Host / Downstream Facing Port (DFP) uses pull-up resistors**. The pull-up resistor Rp must be connected to both CC1 and CC2 pins and pulled up to 3.3V/5V/current source. The value of the pull-up resistor determines the device's power supply current capability through the port, as shown in the table below:

| DFP Power Supply Current Capability            | Pull-up to 4.75V~5.5V | Pull-up to 3.3VÂ±5% | Pull-up to 1.7~5.5V current source |
| ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Default USB Power (USB2.0-500mA, USB3.0-900mA) | 56kâ„¦Â±20%              | 36kâ„¦Â±20%           | 80ÂµAÂ±20%                           |
| 1.5A@5V                                        | 22kâ„¦Â±5%               | 12kâ„¦Â±5%            | 180ÂµAÂ±8%                           |
| 3A@5V                                          | 10kâ„¦Â±5%               | 4.7kâ„¦Â±5%           | 330ÂµAÂ±8%                           |

**Device / Upstream Facing Port (UFP) uses pull-down resistors or voltage clamp**. The value of the pull-down resistor Rd is fixed at 5.1kâ„¦Â±10%.

For cable orientation detection, if CC1 pin detects a valid pull-up or pull-down, it represents the normal orientation (not flipped); if CC1 pin does not detect it, it represents the flipped orientation:
