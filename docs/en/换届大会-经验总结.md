# General Meeting - Summary of Experience

## Problems Encountered

1. Unclear responsibilities of staff members, inadequate notification
2. Unable to borrow a large classroom, unable to borrow speakers, lack of stools in the medium-sized classrooms, some people had to stand without seats
3. Late delivery of KT boards and logo boards
4. Issues with video playback on classroom equipment
5. Inadequate guidance for participants to take their seats
6. The host was not familiar with the entire meeting process; read from the script without improvisation
7. No designated person in charge to handle issues when they arise
8. Design and printing of appointment letters, sorting during the announcement
9. Poor positioning during the group photo, not able to include everyone

## How to Improve

### Two Weeks in Advance

The general meeting is a significant event that requires at least two weeks of preparation. Gather the staff members and hold a planning meeting to discuss the following:

- Overall flow of the general meeting
- Selection of the host, script writing, and training for improvisation
- Identification of speakers and advance notice for speech writing
- Materials needed for borrowing/purchasing, such as signboards, appointment letters, speakers, KT boards, decorations, cameras, etc.
- Rough estimation of participants and invitation of guests (teachers, previous team members)
- Clearly define the responsibilities of staff members (documented on paper)
- Request approval from the responsible teacher for borrowing classrooms (preferably the large classroom on the 4th floor, at least two weeks in advance to avoid it being already borrowed)
- Appoint an overall coordinator for the event, responsible for resolving disagreements in planning and making decisions during unexpected situations

### One Week in Advance

- Send out a notice to all participants and invite guests
- Check and follow up on the delivery of design-related and purchase-related materials
- Design and print appointment letters

The overall coordinator should have a clear understanding of the factors that may delay the progress and start following up one week in advance.

### Half a Day in Advance

- Gather the staff members
- Set up the venue
- Check the status of materials
- Inspect the classroom equipment
- Set up the camera positions for photography
- Rehearse the general meeting flow and the host's performance

Do not wait until shortly before the meeting to hurriedly prepare the classroom. Some issues may only be exposed once in the classroom, so there should be sufficient time to address them.

### During the General Meeting

- Participants sign in
- Guide participants to their seats
- In case of unexpected situations, the overall coordinator should make decisions and handle them

Even with thorough preparation, unexpected situations may still arise during the meeting, leading to a chaotic situation. In such cases, the overall coordinator should make urgent decisions and ensure their execution. Although there may be mistakes in decision-making, it is better than everyone suggesting different methods and being unable to resolve the situation.

### After the General Meeting

- Gather the staff members
- Count and transport materials
- Write a summary report

Compared to last year's general meeting, this year's event had a larger number of participants and a more lively atmosphere with a sense of ceremony. However, various small issues encountered during the process, especially technical problems, did affect the team's reputation.  
Each event encounters both old and new challenges. Only by summarizing and providing more lessons and experiences for the next event (and the next term), can we effectively avoid pitfalls and better control risks. This way, each event can be better than the previous one.
