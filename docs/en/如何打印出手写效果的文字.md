Reference video: [link](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av87409493/?spm_id_from=333.788.videocard.0)

The main steps are as follows:

**Use Handwriting Fonts**: Use a graphics tablet to create your own font library or use someone else's font library directly.  
**Use Word Macro Code**: Randomly adjust the font size and line spacing.  
**Manual Processing**: Create correction marks, age the paper, and use an inkjet printer to make the ink penetrate the back.

This method is suitable for copying a large amount of repetitive content (such as copying texts) or situations where only handwritten materials are allowed in open-book exams.
