### Power Supply

RobotCtrl_Func features 2 LDO channels, similar in principle to RobotCtrl_Core. One channel is used for external sensors, while the other is dedicated to the Ethernet circuit.

### Ethernet Communication Circuit

Ethernet communication is based on an Ethernet PHY chip, using the RMII interface to communicate with the microcontroller. It communicates with external network cables through the RJ45 port, which has a built-in isolation transformer. The clock for the Ethernet circuit uses an external 25M passive crystal oscillator and requires independent power to reduce power interference. Here, the same low dropout linear regulator power supply scheme as the core board is used to power the Ethernet circuit separately. The principles of Ethernet communication can be found in the article [**HAL Library Development Notes - Ethernet Communication (LwIP)**](https://wiki-power.com/HAL%E5%BA%93%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0-%E4%BB%A5%E5%A4%AA%E7%BD%91%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%EF%BC%88LwIP%EF%BC%89).

### CAN Communication Circuit

The CAN communication circuit is built around CAN transceiver chips, using differential voltage levels for transmission. The CAN protocol controller (e.g., microcontroller) is connected to the transceiver via serial lines (RX/TX), which are then converted into CAN signals (CANH/CANL) on the transceiver. The high-speed/silent mode is selected via the RS pin. A 120Î© termination resistor is required on the CAN bus to match impedance and reduce signal reflections. The principles of CAN communication can be found in the articles [**Communication Protocol - CAN**](https://wiki-power.com/%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%E5%8D%8C%E8%AE%AE-CAN) and [**HAL Library Development Notes - Serial Communication**](https://wiki-power.com/HAL%E5%BA%93%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0-CAN%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1).

### Serial Communication Circuit

The RobotCtrl_Func board features an on-board RS-232 level serial communication circuit and additionally provides TTL level USART1/UART5 interfaces. For a detailed understanding of serial communication principles, you can refer to the articles [**Communication Protocols - Serial Communication**](https://wiki-power.com/%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%E5%8D%8C%E8%AE%AE-%E4%B8%B2%E5%8F%A3%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1) and [**HAL Library Development Notes - Serial Communication**](https://wiki-power.com/HAL%E5%BA%93%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0-%E4%B8%B2%E5%8F%A3%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1).

The RS-232 communication circuit employs a TTL to RS-232 level conversion chip, which converts the TTL level of the microcontroller to RS-232 level. To enhance EMC performance, you can connect the DB9 connector shell pins to ground via TVS diodes. The TTL to RS-232 chip requires additional decoupling and bootstrap capacitors.

### Buzzer Circuit

The buzzer circuit utilizes a 12V buzzer and can be controlled with a single transistor.

### User Buttons and LEDs

For an understanding of the principles behind user buttons and LEDs, you can refer to RobotCtrl_Core. Further elaboration is not necessary here.

### Attitude Sensor Module

The MPU6050 module can be directly mounted for use, and I2C interface is reserved for communication with the microcontroller. To learn about the principles of I2C communication, you can refer to the articles [**Communication Protocols - I2C**](https://wiki-power.com/%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%E5%8D%8C%E8%AE%AE-I2C) and [**HAL Library Development Notes - I2C Communication (MPU6050)**](https://wiki-power.com/HAL%E5%BA%93%E5%BC%80%E5%8F%91%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0-I2C%E9%80%9A%E4%BF%A1%EF%BC%88MPU6050%EF%BC%89).

### Infrared Range Sensor Interface

The four-channel infrared range sensor interface circuit operates with 12V power and signals (NPN normally open type) from the infrared sensor. Therefore, 12V power is supplied from RobotCtrl_Power, and four optocoupler isolation chips are added to transmit high and low-level signals. When designing the optocoupler isolation circuit, the value of the current-limiting resistor must be calculated based on the current magnitude, ensuring that it falls within the triggering voltage range specified in the datasheet. You can refer to the article [**Basic Components - Optocoupler**](https://wiki-power.com/%E5%9F%BA%E6%9C%AC%E5%85%83%E5%99%A8%E4%BB%B6-%E5%85%89%E7%94%B5%E8%80%A6%E5%90%88%E5%99%A8) for an understanding of optocouplers.

### Power Input Interface and B2B Connector

The power input interface for the peripheral expansion board consists of 4 rows of pins for connection to the bottom power supply board. The B2B connector is used to provide power and data communication to the main control board.

## Hardware Testing
