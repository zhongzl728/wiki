## Aperture

Aperture is the component in the lens used to control the amount of light entering. (Aperture F value = Lens focal length / Aperture diameter)

In addition to controlling the amount of light, aperture also affects the depth of field. After focusing, objects within a certain distance in front of and behind the focus point will also be clear, and this distance range is the depth of field. (However, the depth of field is not only affected by aperture, but also by the subject distance. The closer the subject is to the lens, the blurrier the background will be, just like our eyes do.)

|          | Large Aperture         | Small Aperture           |
| -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Aperture Size | Large               | Small                    |
| Aperture Value | Smaller (e.g. f/2 or F2) | Larger (e.g. f/22 or F22) |
| Image     | Brighter              | Darker                   |
| Depth of Field | Small (short clear distance) | Large (long clear distance) |
