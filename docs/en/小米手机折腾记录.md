# Xiaomi Phone Troubleshooting Record

Recently, I bought a highly cost-effective phone, the Redmi Note 12 Turbo, and returned to the Android camp. Here, I will record the process of troubleshooting.

## Flashing the European version of MIUI

The reason for giving up the Chinese version of MIUI is that starting from MIUI 13, there are rumors that it has built-in system-level anti-fraud features. I don't want my phone to become a surveillance tool. Moreover, the Chinese version of the ROM comes with a lot of system apps that have annoying advertisements. Even if you turn them off, they will be added back in the next system update. In comparison, the international version of the ROM will generally adhere more to Android's standards and does not have advertisements, making the system relatively clean.

Before flashing the Xiaomi phone, you need to unlock the bootloader (commonly known as unlocking the BL lock). Generally, you need to insert a SIM card and log in to your Xiaomi account, wait for 7 days (the period for returning the phone without reason), and then download the official [**Mi Unlock Tool**](https://www.miui.com/unlock/index.html) from Xiaomi's website to unlock it.

In order to facilitate continuous OTA updates on the phone, I chose to flash the European version EEA (official version) of the ROM. You can find the official download link for the ROM corresponding to your model on [**XiaomiROM.com**](https://xiaomirom.com/). If you don't want the Google suite of apps that cannot be uninstalled, you can try the European version EU (community version), which can be found on [**SourceForge**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xiaomi-eu-multilang-miui-roms/files/xiaomi.eu/).

Flashing the ROM is generally done by using the method of flashing via a data cable connected to a computer. First, you need to download the official [**MiFlash Tool**](https://miuiver.com/miflash/) from Xiaomi. It is important to note that MiFlash only supports Xiaomi's official ROM firmware.

For the specific steps of flashing, you can refer to the [**Xiaomi Phone Flashing Guide**](https://miuiver.com/how-to-flash-xiaomi-phone/). If you encounter error messages during the flashing process, you can refer to the [**Xiaomi Flashing Error List and Solutions**](https://miuiver.com/miflash-problem-list/). Before flashing, remember to back up your data first, refer to [**Xiaomi Phone Data Backup and Restore Methods**](https://miuiver.com/mi-phone-data-backup/); when flashing, try to use the original data cable, connect to the USB 2.0 interface of the computer, and avoid using Chinese characters in the ROM path.

## Using Magisk to Obtain Root Access

Magisk is a powerful Android low-level customization tool that can be used to obtain root access and authorize various functional modules. It also has the ability to hide its own root status to prevent some apps from detecting the system as insecure.

For the specific tutorial on installing Magisk, you can refer to the [**Magisk Installation Tutorial for Xiaomi Phones (Obtaining Root Access on Xiaomi Phones)**](https://magiskcn.com/).

After flashing Magisk and obtaining root access, you can try the following tricks:
