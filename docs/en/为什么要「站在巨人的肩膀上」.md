# Why "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants"

Without effective guidance, beginners often spend a significant amount of time on low-level trial and error. This is why people frequently mock the phrase "from beginner to abandonment." In reality, it only takes a few extra words from a teacher at crucial moments for most individuals to smoothly progress through tutorials, gaining valuable experience, enjoyment, and confidence.

The difference made by those few words may appear minor, but due to the nature of tutorial formats (text being a compressed form of information), they are often overlooked by the instructors. To fundamentally avoid this issue, there needs to be a broader channel of communication between instructors and learners.
