## Background

Imagine having a shared printer in the office that is not connected to a computer, requiring manual switching every time you want to print. In this case, you can use Raspberry Pi as a print server to enable cloud printing sharing.

## Steps

### 1. Preparations

Flash Raspbian system onto Raspberry Pi, and it is recommended to change to a domestic software source.

### 2. Configure Cloud Print Service

Install CUPS plugin:

```shell
sudo apt-get install cups
sudo cupsctl --remote-any
sudo /etc/init.d/cups restart
```

Check the current IP address of Raspberry Pi:

```
$hostname -I
```

Now you can enter the following in your browser:

```
https://your_raspberry_pi_IP:631/
```

Open the CUPS interface. Your browser may display a warning, which can be ignored.

Go to the Administration page and pay attention to the checkboxes on the right:

Add a printer:

Connect the printer to Raspberry Pi using a USB cable. You should be able to see the local USB device: ![](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/dOY25IVr55cf4qbg__thumbnail-1.png)

Add the device directly, choose a simple name, and make sure to check the "share" option: ![](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/zY62367hBa0ZuwJV__thumbnail.png)

Find the corresponding model of the printer and continue with the setup. After the configuration is complete, you can select `Print Test Page` on the printer's page to test if it can print correctly:

### 3. Configure on Windows

Control Panel - Devices and Printers - Add Printer

Enter the IP, for example:

```
http://your_raspberry_pi_IP:631/printers/printer_name_you_set_before
```

Try printing a test page?

## Summary

When you find yourself repeating the same task more than twice, it's time to consider automating the process. Learn to use smart methods to save time and effort.
