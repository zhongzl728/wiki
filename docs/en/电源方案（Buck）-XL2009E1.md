### Output Voltage Regulation

XL2009E1 provides an internal reference voltage of 1.25V. The output voltage is divided by a resistor divider and fed into the FB pin for internal comparison and regulation. It is recommended to use resistors with a deviation of 1% or lower and a temperature coefficient of 100 ppm or lower for the voltage divider. Choosing larger resistor values for the voltage divider helps improve light load efficiency, but if they are too large, the regulator will be more susceptible to noise and voltage errors from the FB input current. It is recommended to use a low-side resistor $R_1$ value of 4.7k and calculate the high-side resistor $R_2$ using the formula:

$$
V_{OUT}=1.25*(1+\frac{R_2}{R_1})
$$

### Schottky Diode Selection

The rated breakdown voltage of the diode is preferably 25% higher than the maximum input voltage. For optimal reliability, the rated current of the diode should be equal to the maximum output current of the regulator. In cases where the input voltage is much higher than the output voltage, the average diode current will be lower. In such cases, a diode with a lower average current rating, approximately $(1-D) * I_{OUT}$, can be used. However, the peak current rating should be higher than the maximum load current.

The datasheet of XL2009E1 provides a direct selection table for a 3A diode:

| Input Voltage | Model       |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| 20V           | SK32        |
| 30V           | SK33/30WQ03 |
| 40V           | SK34/30WQ04 |
| 50V           | SK35/30WQ05 |
| 60V           | SK36        |
