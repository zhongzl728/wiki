# Basic Knowledge of Digital Circuits

## Number Systems and Code Systems

**Number System**: Rules for representing quantities. The composition of each digit and the carry rules from the least significant digit to the most significant digit, such as decimal system.
**Code System**: Rules for representing things, the rules followed when encoding.

**Analog Circuit**: Represents information with continuous analog voltage/current values.
**Digital Circuit**: Represents information with a discrete sequence of voltages.

Commonly used number systems:

> Conversion of any number in any base to decimal:
>
> $(526)_8=5*8^2+2*8^1+6*8^0=(342)_{10}$
>
> $(2A.7F)_H=2*16^1+10*16^0+7*16^{-1}+15*16^{-2}=(42.4960937)_D$
>
> $D=\sum K_iN^i$

### Two's Complement of Binary Numbers

- The highest bit is the sign bit (0 for positive, 1 for negative).
- The two's complement of a positive number is the same as its original representation.
- **The two's complement of a negative number = One's complement of the absolute value + 1**

> +5 = （0 0101）  
> -5 = （1 1011）

> 1101.0110  
> = –2 3 + 2 2 + 2 0 + 2 -2 + 2 -3  
> = – 8 + 4 + 1 + 0.25 + 0.125  
> = – 2.625

### Code Systems

Fixed-length codes:

- 4-bit BCD code
- ASCII
- Gray code: The encoding sequence changes in order, when changing according to the order in the table, only one bit of adjacent codes changes state

**XOR**: 1 if inputs are different, 0 if inputs are the same  
$Y=A'B+AB'$

**XNOR**: 1 if inputs are the same, 0 if inputs are different
$Y=AB+A'B'$

$(A B) ' = A' + B'$  
$(A+ B)' = A'B'$  
$A + B C = (A +B)(A +C)$

### Simplification of Logical Functions

#### The simplest form of logical expressions

Minterms

> It represents the number of rows in the truth table  
> Representing all possible and unique situations

#### Simplification by Formulas

Repeatedly applying basic formulas and common formulas to eliminate redundant AND terms and redundant factors.

#### Simplification by Karnaugh Map

It is not necessary to fully convert to minterms.  
If minterms are repeated, fill in 1.

**If there are fewer 0s, you can also encircle the 0s and take the complement.**

## Gate Circuits

### Positive Logic and Negative Logic

If logic 1 is represented by a high voltage level and logic 0 is represented by a low voltage level, this representation method is called positive logic; otherwise, it is called negative logic.
