I won't go into details here.

## Adjusting Settings

To do a good job, you need good tools. When you first open Altium Designer, you can adjust some settings to make the tool more user-friendly. Find the **gear icon** in the top right corner and **open the settings page**, then follow the steps below.

### Set to Chinese Language

1. On the left panel, click on the **System - General** tab. Under the **Localization** section, check the **Use localized resources** option.
2. Click **Apply** to save the settings and restart Altium Designer.

### PCB Editor

1. Click on the **PCB Editor** tab on the left panel.
2. Under the **PCB Editor** tab, click on the **General** section. Under the **Copper Pour Rebuild** section, check **Rebuild copper after modification**. In the **Document Format Change Report** section, check **Disable open old version reports** and **Disable open new version reports**. In the **Other** section, change the **Cursor Type** to **Large 90**.
3. Click on the **Display** tab. Under the **Highlight Options** section, check **Apply highlight during interactive editing**.
4. Click on the **Board Insight Color Overrides** tab. Under the **Basic Style** section, select **Solid (Override Color)**.
5. Click on the **DRC Violations Display** tab. Under the **Conflict Overlay Style** section, select **Solid (Overlay Color)**.
6. Click **Apply** to save the settings and restart Altium Designer.

### Panels

1. Close the settings page and in the main menu, choose **View - Panels** and select **Components, Messages**.
2. Click the **paperclip icon** in the top right of the pop-up panel to dock the panel on the right side.

### Set Background to Grid

1. Open any PCB file (if you don't have one, create a new one).
2. Press **Ctrl + G** to open the grid settings window.
3. Under the **Display** section, set both **Fine** and **Coarse** options to **Dots**.

## Input Method Compatibility

If you can't use shortcuts, check if you are in English input mode (the input method status bar shows **ENG**). If you don't have this option, follow the steps below:

1. Open the **Control Panel**, then navigate to the **Clock, Language, and Region - Language** section.
2. Click the **Add a language** button, add **English**, and select **English (United States)**.
3. You can switch input methods from the desktop taskbar.
