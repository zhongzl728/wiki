# 3D Printing: The Difference Between ABS and PLA

When it comes to 3D printing, how do you make a sensible choice between ABS and PLA materials?

## ABS Material

ABS (Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene) is a relatively traditional material for 3D printing.

### Printing Temperature

When using ABS for printing, it's common to set the printer nozzle temperature to 210~240°C, and the heated bed temperature to 80°C or higher. Additionally, ABS has a softening temperature of 105°C.

### Printing Performance

Printing with ABS is quite smooth, but it can experience warping and detachment issues when it cools.

### Strength

ABS is known for its high strength and good elasticity, meaning it will bend rather than break even under pressure.

### Odor

ABS emits an odor during printing. It's advisable to use a closed printer or maintain good indoor ventilation to avoid excessive inhalation of fumes.

### Use Cases

ABS is suitable for scenarios that involve frequent impacts, require toughness, and involve relatively high temperatures. However, it's important to note that printers without heated beds cannot be used for ABS printing due to the risk of warping and detachment. Printing in poorly-ventilated rooms should also be avoided.

## PLA Material

PLA (Polylactic Acid), often referred to as a biodegradable plastic, some even meet edible grade standards.

### Printing Temperature

When printing with PLA, it's typical to set the printer nozzle temperature to 180~200°C. While a heated bed is not mandatory, it's recommended to set it at 60°C. PLA has a softening temperature of 60°C.

### Printing Performance

Compared to ABS, PLA is more prone to nozzle clogs during printing because it tends to adhere and stretch after melting. However, it doesn't experience the warping and detachment issues that ABS does.

### Strength

PLA may have slightly lower elasticity and strength, but this can be addressed by adjusting infill and wall thickness settings during printing.

### Use Cases

PLA is considered more environmentally friendly due to its biodegradability, it's relatively cost-effective, doesn't warp easily, and doesn't produce odors during printing. However, PLA is not suitable for high-temperature or impact-prone scenarios, as temperatures above 60°C and physical stress can cause the printed objects to deform or break.
