# Introduction to Machine Learning - Environment Setup

## Anaconda Environment

We choose to use Anaconda to set up the environment for machine learning. On one hand, it comes with many commonly used data science packages such as Numpy, TensorFlow, etc., and includes the modules they depend on; on the other hand, it can easily manage and switch runtime environments. In short, Anaconda is an all-in-one data science programming environment.

Download Anaconda from: [https://www.anaconda.com/download](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

After installation, how do we get started? You can follow this official course step by step: [**Get Started with Anaconda**](https://freelearning.anaconda.cloud/get-started-with-anaconda), or you can directly refer to the following concise steps.

Once the installation is complete, you can verify the installation status and the list of built-in packages by entering the command `conda list` on the Anaconda Prompt command-line interface.

It is recommended by the official documentation to create a virtual environment. This way, if something goes wrong, you can easily switch to another one without having to uninstall and reinstall:

```console
conda create --name NEW_ENV_NAME
conda activate NEW_ENV_NAME
```

The default channel for conda is `defaults`, but this channel does not have all the packages, so it is suggested to change it to conda-forge:

```console
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Next, install some commonly used packages in this virtual environment:

```console
conda install jupyterlab rich faker chime schedule pandas scikit-learn
```

Finally, start JupyterLab:

```console
jupyter lab
```

## scikit-learn Machine Learning Toolkit

In the upcoming articles, we will dive into machine learning with scikit-learn. Scikit-learn (sklearn) contains fundamental and commonly used machine learning algorithms for classification, regression, dimensionality reduction, clustering, as well as modules for feature extraction, data processing, and model evaluation, making it perfect for beginners.
