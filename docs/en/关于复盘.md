# About Review

After the chess game is over, both sides repeat and review the situation that determined the winner or loser.

# Redefining

Whether the process encounters difficulties or proceeds smoothly, reviewing and replaying can enhance experience and provide support for future processes, thereby increasing efficiency.

In daily life, it's akin to learning from one's mistakes. Timely recording and summarizing the pitfalls you've encountered enable you to navigate the path ahead more smoothly. It's like the graph of an exponential growth function.

During a review, when a familiar situation appears before you, you often have the ability to make informed judgments based on experience, choosing a relatively reasonable path among multiple options.
