# Calculation of Solar Altitude Angle

To represent the position of the sun in the sky, it is necessary to first choose a coordinate system. The two commonly used coordinate systems are the equatorial coordinate system and the horizontal coordinate system.

Concepts:

- Latitude $\varphi$: -90° to 90°, with positive values for northern latitudes.

## Equatorial Coordinate System

The equatorial coordinate system takes the celestial equator as the fundamental plane and defines the position of the sun using two quantities: **declination angle** and **hour angle**.

- **Declination angle $\delta$**: The angle between the line connecting the Earth and the sun and the celestial equator.
- **Hour angle $\omega$**: Negative in the morning, positive in the afternoon, numerically equal to the time (in hours) from noon multiplied by 15°.

The declination angle varies between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn (-23.45° to 23.45°) due to the position of the Earth in its orbit:

The formula to calculate the declination angle $\delta$ is as follows:

$$
\delta = 23.45 \sin\left[\frac{360 \times (284 + n)}{365}\right]
$$

where n is the date number within a year (1 to 365).

## Horizontal Coordinate System

The horizontal coordinate system takes the observer's horizon as the fundamental plane. In this coordinate system, we use the **altitude angle** and **azimuth angle** to define the position of the sun in the sky at a specific moment.

Note: To understand this diagram, you need to have a geometric imagination, imagining that the circle is on a flat surface and the sun is above the surface.

- **Altitude angle $\alpha_s$**: The angle between the line connecting the sun's rays and the observer and the projection of this line on the ground.
- **Azimuth angle $\gamma_s$**: The angle between the projection of the line connecting the sun's rays and the observer on the ground and the line pointing due south. The numerical value is 0° for due south, positive for westward direction, and negative for eastward direction.

The formula to calculate the altitude angle $\alpha_s$ is:

$$
\sin \alpha_s = \sin \varphi \sin \delta + \cos \varphi \cos \delta \cos \omega
$$

The formulas to calculate the azimuth angle $\gamma_s$ are:

$$
\sin \gamma_s = \frac{\cos \delta \sin \omega}{\cos \alpha}
$$

$$
\cos \gamma_s = \frac{\sin \alpha \sin \varphi - \sin \alpha}{\cos \alpha \cos \varphi}
$$

## Standard Time and Solar Time

Standard time refers to the civil time (e.g., Beijing Time), while solar time is based on noon (12:00) as the reference time.

For example, in Beijing and Urumqi, the highest solar altitude occurs at solar noon (12:00). However, in standard time, the highest solar altitude in Urumqi (i.e., noon) is around 14:00.
