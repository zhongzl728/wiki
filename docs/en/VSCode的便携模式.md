# Portable Mode for VS Code

VS Code natively supports a portable mode, but extension settings and other resources are still stored in the default local location. This tutorial will guide you on how to make VS Code completely portable.

1. Download the `.zip` version of VS Code from the [**download page**](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads).

2. After extracting the files, do not open the software. Instead, create a `data` folder within the software's root directory and, optionally, create a `tmp` directory inside it to store temporary data.

3. Now you can open the software.
