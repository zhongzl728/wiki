# Power Supply Design - Bootstrap Circuit

The bootstrap circuit, in simple terms, is about lifting itself up. Its principle lies in the utilization of bootstrap capacitors to boost voltage in a circuit.

We often encounter bootstrap capacitors in circuits like Buck converters and motor driver H-bridges. Taking N-MOS as an example, **the fundamental reason for the need for bootstrapping is because the $V_{ds}$ (drain-source voltage) is quite low, making it unable to meet the conduction requirement of $V_{gs}>V_{(gs)gh}$. According to the principle that the voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously, we can generate a higher voltage at the gate by superimposing it with the voltage across the capacitor, thus enabling the MOSFET to conduct.**

Compared to other boost topology structures, the bootstrap circuit has the advantage of being cost-effective and having a simple circuit structure.

## The Bootstrap Process

Let's analyze the bootstrap circuit in the context of half-bridge driver:

In the first stage (lower switch drive phase, with $Q_1$ off and $Q_2$ on), the bootstrap capacitor $C_B$ is being charged. During this period, the charging current from the source $V_{DD}$ flows into the driver chip's $VDDA$ pin. Through the charging loop of the capacitor, it travels through the bootstrap resistor $R_B$, diode $D_1$, capacitor $C_B$, and $Q_2$ to the ground.

In the second stage (upper switch drive phase, with $Q_2$ off and $Q_1$ on), the voltage at the source terminal of $Q_1$ (connected to GNDA pin) rapidly rises to the drain voltage VDRAIN. **Because the voltage across the capacitor cannot change instantaneously**, the voltage at VDDA is equal to the source voltage of $Q_1 plus the voltage across $C_B$ ($C_B$ has been charged to approximately VDDâ€“0.7V). As the source voltage of $Q_1$ (and GNDA) rises, diode $D_1$ becomes reverse-biased, disconnecting the connection between the VDD supply and $C_B$. At this point, $C_B$ supplies all the current required for the upper switch drive phase.
