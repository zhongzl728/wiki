# Semiconductor Testing Basics - Basic Concepts

With the increasing integration of chips, manual testing is no longer sufficient to meet the demand, so automated test equipment (ATE) is used. Because chips are becoming more and more complex, ordinary bench testing cannot meet the requirements. ATE can detect the integrity of integrated circuit functions and is the final process in integrated circuit production and manufacturing, ensuring product quality. Chip testing is considered the most downstream component in the semiconductor industry chain. The devices under test (DUT) for testing are mainly divided into several categories: memory, digital circuits, analog circuits, and mixed-signal circuits.

ATE has many subsystems, including high and low level drive circuits, programmable current loads, voltage comparators for detecting output voltage, PMU connection circuits, high-speed current comparators, and high-speed switches.

From the above figure, it can be seen that the testing system mainly consists of three parts: input, output, and dynamic load:

- **Input section**: Provides VIL/VIH voltage to the DUT.
- **Output section**: Compares the output voltage of the DUT with VOL/VOH.
- **Dynamic load**
  - By loading IOL/IOH current, the output voltage is obtained and compared with VOL/VOH.
  - Directly compares the output current with ILow/IHigh (usually only available on high-end machines).

The most basic testing involves measuring DC and AC parameters. The DC parameter measurement can be done using the Static method, which uses the PE card's driver and PMU to force V and measure I or force I and measure V. It can also be done using the Functional method, which uses current load and voltage comparators to run patterns for testing.

## Signal Input and Output

How signals are generated and input to the DUT:

### Input Signal Formats

![](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/20220806184824.png)

- **RZ (Return to Zero)**: In this coding scheme, data bits are transmitted in binary within one cycle, and after the data bit pulse ends, a low level needs to be maintained. This coding scheme can simultaneously transmit clock and data signals, but the transmission efficiency is relatively low due to the occupation of some bandwidth by the zero level. The positions of the rising and falling edges can be controlled by Edge Timing.
- **RO (Return to One)**: In this coding scheme, the opposite of RZ, a high level needs to be maintained. The positions of the rising and falling edges can be controlled by Edge Timing.
- **NRZ (Non Return to Zero)**: The difference between NRZ and RZ is that NRZ does not need to return to zero, so one cycle can be used to transmit data, with a bandwidth utilization rate of 100%. If low-speed asynchronous data is transmitted, a clock line may not be required, but the communication baud rate needs to be agreed upon (such as UART); for high-speed synchronous data transmission, a separate clock line is required. NRZ is not controlled by Edge Timing.
- **DNRZ (Delayed Non Return to Zero)**: DNRZ is an NRZ waveform with time delay. The delay time is controlled by Edge Timing.
- **SBC (Surrounded By Complement)**: SBC is a combination of RZ and RO. It can have up to 3 edges within one cycle. At T0, the data is inverted, and after a certain delay, it appears as the preset value, and then it is inverted again after a certain time. SBC is mostly used for establishing/maintaining signal control.
- **ZD (Impedance Drive)**: Impedance drive is used to control pin opening or closing (high impedance state).

Clock signals usually use RZ/RO formats, signals with rising edge validity (such as chip select CS or read READ) usually use RZ format, and signals with falling edge validity (such as output enable OE) usually use RO format. Data signals with setup and hold time requirements often use SBC format. Other input signals can use NRZ or DNRZ formats.

### Output Signal Formats

#### High and Low Level Output

Translate into English:

![](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/20220806200604.png)

When the pin outputs a high or low logic level, the high level must be higher than VOH, and the low level must be lower than VOL.

#### High-impedance output

![](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/20220806201343.png)

The DUT pin is pulled to a voltage between VOL and VOH by an external load and cannot output voltage or current.

#### Load current output

Some DUT pins can output load current. If the test system has a programmable current load, it can be tested directly. Otherwise, an external resistor may be required for testing. Load current output needs to output the specified IOL/IOH current when VOL/VOH meets the standard.

### CP Test and FT Test

CP (Chip Probe) test is a performance and functional test of the chip conducted by probing the chip pins while the chip is still in the wafer stage. FT (Final Test) is the final test conducted after the chip is packaged.

### Hot Switching

Hot switching, also known as current-carrying switching, refers to the switching of relays while current is flowing (there can be voltage, as long as the voltage on both sides is consistent). This may shorten the lifespan of the relay or damage it, so programming is required to avoid such situations.

### Latch-up

When a pin is subjected to excessive voltage, it causes a large current to flow in CMOS devices, resulting in local circuit damage or even burnout.

### Stuck-At Fault

Stuck-At Fault (SAF) refers to a signal pin that is stuck at a 0/1/Z level due to manufacturing defects, causing a fault.

### Binning

Binning is the process of grouping DUTs based on test results. For example:

![](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/20220728223700.png)

Hard Binning refers to using machines like Handlers to classify into two groups; Soft Binning refers to recording and distinguishing defective products in software without physical classification.

The binning process requires at least two bins to differentiate whether a test result passes or fails.

### Program Flow

The design of the program flow is crucial for the entire testing process. For example, some DC tests require pre-processing (setting specific device logic, such as functional testing), and the lack of pre-processing will render the results of subsequent steps meaningless.

The design of the program flow needs to consider many factors, such as the test volume, which parameters need to be tested, and how to perform binning. Flowcharts are usually used to present the program flow and ensure that it meets the requirements.
