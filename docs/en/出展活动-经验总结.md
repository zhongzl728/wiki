# Exhibition Event - Experience Summary

## Points to Note

- Notify in advance to ensure that exhibition materials are not occupied.
- Mechanical and hardware issues must be reported at least one day in advance, and software issues at least half a day in advance. Maintain a stable version at all times and be ready to roll back if necessary.
- Upon receiving event notification, create an event plan immediately and obtain unanimous approval from the management. The plan should include the following:

  - Specific Time Schedule
    - Request a complete event flow/timetable from the event coordinator (e.g., the lead teacher).
  - Personnel Allocation
    - Designate responsible individuals for robots; each robot should have at least two people in charge.
    - Create groups, including rotational groups, and appoint a transportation leader (responsible for taxis and cargo).
    - Once finalized, avoid making changes to the list of personnel, even in the case of replacements.
  - Travel Arrangements
    - List pickup and destination locations in advance on paper.
    - Cargo Transport
      - Estimate the cargo van's interior volume first.
      - The person who orders the cargo van should accompany it with tools like ties, cutting pliers, etc.
    - Personnel Travel
      - Operators and cargo handlers should take a Didi (ride-sharing) to the destination to pick up the cargo.
      - Other team members should take a taxi after the cargo van.
  - Inventory List
    - Competition materials: cars, batteries, chargers, computers, downloaders, etc., to be organized by the competition team leader.
    - Other materials: ties, cutting pliers, tools, masks, medications, umbrellas, hand trucks, flight cases, electrical tape, wire, etc., to be organized by the miscellaneous team leader.
    - Before departure, double-check the list.
    - During the journey, conduct periodic checks and distribute materials to individuals (Note: each car should have two people - one with a remote control and one handling the cargo). During transitions, ensure that someone is responsible for preventing loss.
  - Contingency Plan
    - Designate two to three responsible individuals.
    - Determine the ultimate decision-making authority in case of emergencies.
    - Focus on solving problems first, and then assess responsibility and make improvements when the situation is stable.
