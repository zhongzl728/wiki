# Design of High-Speed Circuits ðŸš§

## Factors to Consider in High-Speed PCB Design

- Cost control
- Layer stack-up principles
- Layout principles
- Routing principles
- Impedance design
- Signal integrity
- Power integrity
- EMC design
- Thermal design
- DFM design

## Differences Between Two-Layer and Multilayer Boards

- Calculation of reference planes and impedance
- Shorter return paths in multilayer boards
- Easier routing
- Higher cost of multilayer boards

## Layer Stack-up Guidelines

- Components and soldering surfaces should have complete ground planes (for shielding purposes)
- Avoid adjacent parallel routing layers as much as possible (to prevent interference)
- All signal layers should be adjacent to ground planes; critical signals should be adjacent to ground layers without crossing split planes (to minimize return paths)

Based on the above, the recommended layer stack-up scheme is:

- Top layer: Signal 1
- Inner layer 1: Ground
- Inner layer 2: Power
- Bottom layer: Signal 2

To reduce edge radiation, the power layer should be pulled back at least 1 mm from the ground layer.

## PCB Impedance Design Requirements for Different Communication Protocols

| High-Speed Signal | Impedance Requirement | Tolerance | Routing |
| ----------------- | -------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| DDR               | 100Î©                | Â±10%      |         |
| eMMC              | 50Î©                 | Â±10%      |         |
| PCIe              |                      |           |         |
| USB               | 90Î©                 | Â±10%      | Differential |
| HDMI              | 100Î©                | Â±10%      |         |
| eDP               | 90Î©                 | Â±10%      | Differential |
| MIPI              | 100Î©                | Â±10%      | Differential |
| SDIO/SDMMC        | 50Î©                 | Â±10%      |         |

## Some Basic Concepts

- **Signal Integrity**: Signal integrity refers to the quality of a signal on a signal line. Good signal integrity means that the signal has the necessary voltage levels when needed.
- **Transmission Line**: A transmission line is a connection line composed of two conductors
