  - Currently tested and supported systems include popular versions of Windows, Windows Server, Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, RHEL, Deepin, VMware ESXi, and 202 other systems.
- Supports ISO files larger than 4GB.
- Boots directly from the ISO file without the need for extraction.
- Fast (copy files as fast as possible).
- Does not affect the normal use of the USB drive.
