# A Day in the Life of a Product Manager

## Daily Schedule

**The most important thing is to determine what needs to be done today.** For a product manager, the top priority is deciding what both the team members and oneself should focus on for the day. It's not just about managing one's own time but also allocating significant attention and time to the tasks of team members because, after all, **a product manager's success relies on the contributions of others**.

> So, when I arrive at the office in the morning, the first thing I do is organize my daily schedule on Todoist, and I allocate tasks that require the involvement of others to our team's collaborative tools, aiming to complete this before other colleagues arrive. If a colleague arrives during this process, I pause my work to **confirm what tasks they have planned for the day, continuing this process until I've communicated with all the colleagues I need to confirm schedules with**.

**Product managers must be well-informed about the progress and plans of other team members**. Without this understanding, certain insights can be challenging to establish:

- What stages has the product gone through, from design to the final product?
- Which features can be developed together to make the design and development process more streamlined?
- How much time has been devoted to individual features during development?
- Why does frequent changes in requirements cause significant challenges for colleagues?

## The MVP Principle

The MVP principle, which stands for Minimum Viable Product, was originally introduced by Eric Ries in his book "The Lean Startup." It suggests that when you're looking to build a product, you should initially implement it in the simplest way possible. Once you've ensured that users are on board, you can then continue to refine it.
