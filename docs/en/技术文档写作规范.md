# Technical Document Writing Guidelines

As we all know, having a consistent style and adhering to grammar rules can make articles more readable and reduce communication costs.

## Article Structure

When writing technical articles, you can refer to the following structure:

```markdown
# Article Title

A sentence or two introducing the content of the article.

## Demo

Please provide a brief introduction to the usage of the demo and demonstrate its effects.

## Principle

Please gradually introduce the principles.

## Conclusion

Provide a simple summary.

## References and Acknowledgements

- [Reference 1](Link to Reference 1)
- [Reference 2](Link to Reference 2)
```

## Formatting Guidelines

### Paragraphs

- When using Markdown syntax, the first line does not need to be indented.
- There should be a blank line between paragraphs to differentiate them.

### Scenarios Requiring Spaces

- Between Chinese and English, and between Chinese and numbers:
  > Incorrect: `Qt生成器是一个针对C++的跨平台IDE`  
  > Correct: `Qt 生成器是一个针对 C++ 的跨平台 IDE`
- Between numbers and units (except between numbers and percentage sign):
  > Incorrect: `其频率为 72MHz，占空比为 50 %。`  
  > Correct: `其频率为 72 MHz，占空比为 50%。`
- Between regular text and special characters (links, bold, italics, etc.):
  > This **font** uses bold style.
  > Please **[click here](https://wiki.wildwolf.pw/)** to subscribe.
- After English half-width punctuation marks:
  > Hello, world
- Between Chinese and em dash:
  > Markdown - a efficient way of writing

### Text Styles

1. When mixing Chinese and English, use Chinese full-width punctuation marks by default.
2. When mixing Chinese and English, if there is a complete English sentence, use English half-width punctuation marks within that sentence.
3. Inline links are generally bolded to improve readability.
4. Use accurate proper nouns:
   > Incorrect: 使用 github 登录  
   > Correct: 使用 GitHub 登录
5. Use straight quotation marks for Chinese, instead of regular quotation marks:
   > Incorrect: 华广机器人队，也称为“野狼队”  
   > Correct: 华广机器人队，也称为「野狼队」
6. Avoid repeating punctuation marks for emphasis.

## Writing Style

- If it is not necessary, do not add unnecessary entities.
- To improve readability, try to avoid using long sentences and break them into multiple simple sentences if possible.
- Arguments should be supported by evidence, avoid making claims without examples.
