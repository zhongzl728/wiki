# THE Hack 2019 Hackathon

## Preface

THE Hack 2019 Hackathon was held at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My friends and I participated in this competition and achieved the 8th place overall and the Ruff Award after 36 hours of challenging ideation.

## Project Journey

This year's competition had different topics, and we initially chose the direction of smart homes, intending to create a smart home kit for dormitories. However, we eventually decided to focus on the topic of **how to enable vulnerable groups in technology to enjoy the fun of technology**. With the help of a team responsible for product development, we broadened our perspective this year, not only considering the technical aspects but also taking psychology and user needs into account. We analyzed the topic and thought about what the judges and sponsors value the most.

Our project this year was called AIO - Care, a smart elderly care platform based on an active learning model. I was responsible for the hardware implementation, which involved linking various sensors to collect data for the server to analyze and provide a more comfortable home care experience for the elderly.

The product's concept and direction were led by Amihua Lau and Ada, who served as product managers. They did an excellent job in this aspect. In addition, Amihua Lau also handled the machine learning algorithms and PowerPoint presentations, while Ada, as the Human Resource, provided us with a lot of help and advice (which directly determined the direction of our product). Ada also provided us with countless snacks and drinks, ensuring strong logistical support. Their contributions were beyond my reach, and they truly deserved to be the leaders of our team. Additionally, I would like to thank our neighboring team member, Yi Lin Weng, for creating a 3D model of our product.

I was responsible for the simple implementation of the hardware, and the code has been open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/linyuxuanlin/Project-of-THE-Hack). It is a simple demo based on Arduino, so I won't go into detail.

Compared to the competition two years ago, where we only focused on the technical aspects, this time we developed a complete business model and profit model. We learned about the strategies of this type of competition and gained a lot of experience from excellent team projects. This is just the beginning, and I believe that we will achieve even better results in next year's Hackathon.

In this type of competition, the direction of human care is always highly valued. From the perspective of sponsors, it is always more important than the level of technical advancement. In the 36-hour competition, we could only develop a simple demo in terms of technology. It is the rendering and packaging of the product that truly sets it apart. By presenting the creativity and concept of the product to the sponsors, we can increase our chances of winning in this type of competition.
