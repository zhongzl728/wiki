# Spring Cleaning - Experience Template

Every time we do spring cleaning, our team is generally responsible for the following areas: B3-401 indoor area, two freshman areas, B3-401 and 402 exterior corridors, assembly room, processing room material room, and greenhouse classroom inside and outside.

The general tasks for spring cleaning include desk organization (no plastic bottles, breakfast bags, snack bags, and personal items should be neatly organized), floor cleaning (sweeping and mopping), cleaning the award platform (removing dust), and cleaning the windows when there is a leadership inspection.

Before spring cleaning, it is usually necessary to announce the attendance and ensure that everyone is present and participating.
