# Introduction to Machine Vision

## Environment Setup

First, we need to install the necessary software:

- [**Python**](https://www.python.org/downloads/): Download the latest version of Python. Make sure to select the "Add Python to PATH" option during installation to simplify the environment setup.
- [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Download VS Code. You can refer to the article [**VS Code Productivity Guide - Environment Setup**](https://wiki-power.com/VSCode%E7%94%9F%E4%BA%A7%E5%8A%9B%E6%8C%87%E5%8D%97-%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E9%85%8D%E7%BD%AE) for configuration instructions.
  - [**Python Extension**](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python): VS Code extension

Next, install the required packages. In VS Code, click on the menu bar `View` - `Terminal` to open the terminal, and enter the following commands:

Install opencv-contrib-python:

```shell
pip install opencv-contrib-python
```

Install Matplotlib:

```shell
pip install matplotlib
```

Install scikit-image:

```shell
pip install scikit-image
```

Install dlib. Since direct installation may cause errors, we need to download the .whl file first: [**Download Link**](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/linyuxuanlin/File-host/software-development/dlib-19.21.1-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl)

Navigate to the directory where the file is located and run the command:

```shell
pip install dlib-19.21.1-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl
```

Install face-recognition:

```shell
pip install face-recognition
```

Install cvlib:

```shell
pip install cvlib
```

Install keras:

```shell
pip install keras
```

Install tensorflow:

```shell
pip install tensorflow
```

If the previous command fails, you can try the following command:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.12.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

Install flask:

```shell
pip install flask
```

With these steps, the environment for machine vision is now configured.

## Notes

To resolve the issue of relative path errors, add the following statement:

```shell
import os
dirname, filename = os.path.split(os.path.abspath( __file__))
os.chdir(dirname)
```
