# Card-based Writing

Traditional outline-based writing often leads to "mental block," with the most typical example being the struggle the night before submitting a paper.

> Concept of cognitive tunnel:
> When all attention is focused on the urgent matter at hand, it becomes narrow and limited, making it easy to overlook global information and fail to see the big picture.

On the other hand, card-based writing, similar to function encapsulation in programming, emphasizes bottom-up abstraction, layer by layer. When needed, the cards can be directly called upon. This not only facilitates reuse (avoiding reinventing the wheel), but also sparks new ideas when the cards collide.

## Approach

**Long-term Collection**: Record ideas that are seen or thought of in daily life, with each topic having its own card.  
Tools: Notable notes + Nutstore synchronization.

**Stage Sharing**: Select cards recorded at each stage, without making any further modifications, and integrate them into articles for publication on the public account, titled "Selected Fragments: Issue n."  
Tools: Public account platform.

**Project Writing**: When writing articles on specific topics, relevant cards can be incorporated and further refined. Alternatively, cards can be randomly combined to generate new sparks of thought.  
Tools: Personal website.
