# Self-Improvement of a Servo Motor

How to modify a servo motor to achieve 360° continuous rotation and eliminate noise through code?

## Background

Typically, servo motors can only rotate up to 180° (although continuous rotation servos are available online, they tend to be more expensive). If you wish to use a servo motor for driving a small vehicle, you can convert it into a continuous rotation servo.

## Modifying the Servo for 360° Rotation

### 1. Preparations

Tools needed:

- Screwdriver
- Hot glue gun
- Needle-nose pliers

### 2. Disassemble the Servo

**Make sure to take note of the position of each gear.**

### 3. Modify the Gears

Remove the largest gear and use needle-nose pliers to trim off the protruding part from the back. ![Modified Gear](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/2218072-2fab2f9620b5efb2.jpg)

Find a screwdriver with a slightly larger diameter than the shaft, and enlarge the inner diameter of this gear to allow it to rotate freely on the shaft. ![Enlarging the Gear](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/2218072-b5de55e257df450e.jpg)

### 4. Seal the Potentiometer

Before proceeding with this step, you must return the servo motor to its **center position**.

![Center Position](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/2218072-3f7127da4c2c8d88.jpg)

Use an Arduino board to program the servo motor to return to its center position:

```cpp
// by Lin
#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo;
void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9); // Connect the servo to Arduino's D9
}

void loop() {
  myservo.write(90); // Move the servo to the center position
}
```

![Arduino Setup](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/2218072-41374b07e5f87b06.png)

As shown, connect the servo, and you will notice it continuously rotating.

Rotate the shaft on the right back and forth a few times to find a position that makes the motor stop (adjust the potentiometer to the middle value). ![Potentiometer Adjustment](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/2218072-964d07b3c4c304d4.jpg)

Apply glue to the potentiometer to seal it. Be careful not to accidentally turn the shaft during this step; if that happens, you'll need to return to step three.

### 5. Reassembly

![Reassembly](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/2218072-d0aec7a2cb430e4c.jpg)

Reassemble the gears, ensuring they are in the correct positions. Secure the screws, and you will have a 360° continuous rotation servo.

### 6. Testing

Upload the following code:

```cpp
// Your testing code here
```

This will allow you to test the modified servo motor's performance.

```cpp
#include <Servo.h>
Servo myservo;
int pos = 0;

void setup() {
  myservo.attach(9);
}

void loop() {
  for (pos = 0; pos <= 180; pos += 1) {
    // Moving in 1-degree steps
    myservo.write(pos);
    delay(15);
  }
  for (pos = 180; pos >= 0; pos -= 1) {
    myservo.write(pos);
    delay(15);
  }
}
```

## Eliminating Noise

### Background

> When using servos to create IoT devices, it's often encountered that **servos make noise even after reaching the desired position**. This can be quite annoying. @张世博 came up with a method to add a relay in the servo's power supply line and turn off the power when the servo doesn't need to move. However, this method increases hardware costs and adds code complexity.

### Solution

When the servo needs to work, use the `attach()` function, and after the servo has finished working, use the `detach()` function.

```cpp
{
    servo.attach(9);
    servo.write(pos);
    delay(250);

    // Disconnect the servo to prevent noise
    servo.detach();
}
```

## FAQ

Q: This is for a specific type of servo. How can I modify it for metal servos with different structures?
