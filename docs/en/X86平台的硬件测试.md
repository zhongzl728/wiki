# Hardware Testing for X86 Platform ðŸš§

## Performance Testing

### SD Interface Speed

**Testing Method**: Insert a TF card into the SD slot and use CrystalDiskMark software to test SEQ1M-Q8T6 (other parameters set to default).

### EMMC Read/Write Speed

**Testing Method**: Use CrystalDiskMark software to test SEQ1M-Q8T6 (other parameters set to default).

### SATA Interface Speed

**Testing Method**: Connect a SATA SSD to the SATA interface and use CrystalDiskMark software to test SEQ1M-Q8T5 (other parameters set to default).

### M.2 M key NVME Interface Speed

**Testing Method**: Connect an NVME SSD to the M.2 M key interface and use CrystalDiskMark software to test SEQ1M-Q8T4 (other parameters set to default).

### M.2 B key USB2.0 Interface Speed

**Testing Method**: Connect a B key test module to the M.2 B key interface and use CrystalDiskMark software to test SEQ1M-Q8T3 (other parameters set to default).

### M.2 B key SATA Interface Speed

**Testing Method**: Connect a SATA SSD to the M.2 B key interface and use CrystalDiskMark software to test SEQ1M-Q8T2 (other parameters set to default).

### USB TYPE-C Interface Speed

**Testing Method**: Connect a high-speed USB drive to the USB TYPE-C interface and use CrystalDiskMark software to test SEQ1M-Q8T1 (other parameters set to default).

### USB3.0 Interface Speed

**Testing Method**: Connect a high-speed USB drive to the USB3.0 interface and use CrystalDiskMark software to test SEQ1M-Q8T1 (other parameters set to default).

### USB2.0 Interface Speed

**Testing Method**: Connect a high-speed USB drive to the USB2.0 interface and use CrystalDiskMark software to test SEQ1M-Q8T1 (other parameters set to default).

### Ethernet Communication Speed

**Testing Method**: Connect an RJ45 cable directly to a host, and use Iperf3 software for testing. The host uses the command `iperf3 -s`, while the X86 system uses `iperf3 -c <host IP>`.

## Function Testing

### Power Recovery Mode

**Testing Method**: In the BIOS, set `Chipset` - `Restore on AC Power Loss` to `Last State`.

**Expected Result**: After a power loss and subsequent power restoration, the computer should return to its state before the power loss. If the computer was in an on state before the power loss, it should automatically power on upon restoration. If it was in an off state before the power loss, it should remain off upon restoration.

### Boot Option Priority

**Testing Method**: In the BIOS, adjust the `Boot` - `Boot Option Priorities` to select different boot disks.

**Expected Result**: It should be possible to modify and save the boot options and boot from the selected boot disk.

### Secure Boot ðŸš§

**Testing Method**: Access the BIOS and enable Secure Boot.

**Expected Result**: After enabling Secure Boot, the system should not boot from unauthenticated devices.

### 3.5mm Headphone Jack and Onboard Microphone

**Testing Method**: Use the online tool <https://mymictest.com/zh> to test recording and playback.

**Expected Result**: Recording and playback should function normally.

### Wi-Fi Support

**Testing Method**: In the BIOS, set `Chipset` - `WIFI Support` to `Disable`.

**Expected Result**: After disabling Wi-Fi support, Wi-Fi functionality should not be available within the system.

### Onboard LAN

**Testing Method**: In the BIOS, set `Chipset` - `OnBoard Lan` to `Disable`.

**Expected Result**: After disabling onboard LAN, wired network functionality should not be available within the system.

### LAN Wakeup ðŸš§

**Testing Method**: In the BIOS, disable Wake on LAN.

**Expected Result**: After disabling LAN Wakeup, the network indicator light should turn off, and the system should be unable to wake up through network activity.

### CPU Information Recognition

**Testing Method**: Access the BIOS and check the CPU model on the home screen.

**Expected Result**: The CPU model should be correctly recognized.

### PXE Boot ðŸš§

ðŸš§

### eMMC Support

**Test Method**: In the BIOS, set `Chipset` - `eMMC Support` to `Disable`.

**Expected Result**: After disabling, the eMMC disk should not be detected.

### Fan Speed

**Test Method**: In the BIOS, navigate to `Advanced` - `H/W Monitor`.

**Expected Result**: Real-time fan speed should be displayed correctly.

### RTC Wake-up ðŸš§

**Test Method**: Access the BIOS, enable RTC wake-up, and set a wake-up time.

**Expected Result**: The set time should wake up the system as expected.

### USB Type-C Video Output

**Test Method**: Connect a USB Type-C cable to a 4K/60Hz (adjustable per configuration) monitor and observe the display.

**Expected Result**: Video output should function normally.

### Bluetooth Functionality

**Test Method**: Check the system's Bluetooth options and attempt to connect a Bluetooth device.

**Expected Result**: Devices should be discoverable and connectable without issues.

### Wi-Fi Functionality

**Test Method**: Check the system's Wi-Fi options and attempt to connect to Wi-Fi.

**Expected Result**: Wi-Fi connection should work without any problems.

## Security Testing

### USB 3.0/2.0 Overcurrent Protection

**Test Method**: Use a USB to bare wire adapter, apply an electronic load to draw more than 2A of current, and observe if overcurrent protection activates. Then, reduce the current below 2A and observe if power is restored. (Specific current values should depend on circuit design.)

**Expected Result**: Overcurrent protection should engage during overcurrent conditions, and power should be restored under normal current conditions.
