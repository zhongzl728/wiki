# How to Separate Tracks from Music

Deezer, a music streaming company from France, has open-sourced a track separation software called spleeter. With just a simple command, you can separate the vocals and various instrument tracks from a piece of music. It supports common audio formats such as mp3, wav, and ogg.

Spleeter also supports GPU acceleration. When running on a GPU, it can achieve a speed 100 times faster than real-time separation. This means that separating a 5-minute song only takes 3 seconds.

Within just one week of its release on GitHub, spleeter has already garnered 2.4K stars and has generated over 1000 points of interest on Hacker News.
