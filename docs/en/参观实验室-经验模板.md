# Laboratory Visit - Experience Template

A laboratory visit is an essential activity every year, whether it is for freshmen or leaders. The difference lies in the approach: for freshmen, it should be down-to-earth and not involve too much theoretical knowledge. It is enough to explain what robots are and what functions they have. The goal is to generate interest in the laboratory and encourage them to join us. If they show interest, we can then provide detailed explanations about the professional applications. On the other hand, when explaining to leaders, we can directly discuss professional knowledge because we represent the school and aim to showcase the technology and expertise we possess.

Most people won't listen attentively to explanations; they just want to see the machines in action.

During the laboratory visit, the following aspects are the most important:

## S1 Exhibition Area

Optional. Since these are not our own creations, there is no need for explanations. Just make them move to attract attention.

## Certificate Area

> Our HuaGuang Robot Wolf Team mainly participates in two competitions: the RoboMaster Robotics Competition and the ROBOCON National College Robot Competition.
>
> We are a team with research capabilities, and these are the certificates we have won in recent years, all of which are first and second place at the national level.
>
> These are photos of our competitions and our team's daily activities. Take a look, everyone.

## Infantry Activity Area

The infantry activity area is a horizontal area along the outer wall of B3-401. It mainly demonstrates the infantry's omnidirectional movement and auto-aiming functions. A caution line should be set up.

> Come and take a look, this is our infantry robot. Its role in the competition is to launch projectiles and hit the enemy's armor plate to eliminate opponents. The whole competition is like playing the game "King of Glory" (show video). By destroying the enemy's crystal, which we call the base, we can achieve victory.
>
> These are our two infantry robots. As you can see, this one can automatically identify and aim at targets. This is the task of our computer vision algorithm team, which is like providing an aimbot for the robot. It allows us to better lock onto the opponent's robot during the competition.

## Static Exhibition Area

This area can display previous years' robots (non-moving) and unmanned aerial vehicles.

> Take a look, everyone. This is our quadruped robot from last year's ROBOCON competition.
>
> This is the hero robot of RoboMaster. The difference between it and the infantry robot is that it launches large projectiles (demonstrate by holding it), which cause ten times the damage compared to the infantry's small projectiles.
>
> This is RoboMaster's unmanned aerial vehicle. Its role is to provide an aerial perspective for our team and also has the ability to launch projectiles, causing damage to enemy robots and bases.
>
> Take a look at this. It's the first-person perspective we have during the competition, just like playing a first-person shooter game, but controlling the physical robots on the field.

## Engineering, Magic Symbols, and Sentry Area

This deeper area can be cordoned off, and the inside can be displayed to the outside.

> Over here, let's take a look at this robot. It's called the engineering robot, and its role is to pick up ammunition boxes and distribute large and small projectiles to the infantry and hero robots. It can also revive them when they are eliminated. So the engineering robot mainly serves as a logistics support unit.
>
> Over there, we have a prop from the competition called the Magic Symbol. Each time, only one fan leaf randomly lights up. If our infantry robot hits the lit fan leaf, it can gain buffs such as increased attack power.
>
> On the far left is our sentry robot. Its characteristic is that it operates fully automatically without manual control and can aim and attack enemy robots.
>
> The function of automatic target recognition and aiming requires the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms. This includes the recognition of the Magic Symbol we just mentioned (pointing), which is the responsibility of the computer vision algorithm team.

## Others

> Regarding our internal divisions, you can take a look at the murals on the wall (I will post them tomorrow).
> The mechanical team is mainly responsible for building the robots.
> The electronic control team is mainly responsible for writing and debugging the robot's control code.
> The computer vision team is mainly responsible for writing some "cheats" (referring to external modules).
> The hardware circuit team is mainly responsible for designing and manufacturing circuit boards for the robots (let me show you the main control board).
> And there is also the software team, which develops practical software for the team, such as the mini-program we use to manage supplies, as well as websites and blogs.
>
> In the administrative team, we have the publicity and planning team and the finance team. You can also scan the QR code to follow our official account and learn more.
>
> To join the laboratory, we don't have any specific requirements. As long as you are interested in us and have enthusiasm, you can join us.
>
> You can scan the QR code to follow us or scan the QR code on the wall for a chance to win a prize~

Here are some technical details that can be referred to (do not read them verbatim):

S1 Exhibition Area
Introduction: RoboMaster S1 - Simple Movement
Explanatory Text: The robot we see here is the RoboMaster S1, an educational robot released by DJI in June of last year. I believe everyone is familiar with the RoboMaster Robotics Competition, and the S1 robot is derived from this event. Based on the exploration and accumulation from this competition, DJI developed the S1 and promoted it to allow everyone to experience the charm of robots firsthand. Interested students can try it out (experience controlling it through the mobile app).

## Certificate Area
Introduction: Past Awards
Script: This is the achievement area of our Wolf Team since its establishment three years ago. Although we haven't been around for long, our accomplishments are evident. We have received first, second, and third place awards, which demonstrates our team's research capabilities. We also look forward to your joining us and injecting more energy into our team. (Explaining the certificates)

## Infantry Area
Introduction: Omni-directional Movement / Mini Gyro / Waist Twist, Visual Recognition
Script: This is the infantry robot in our Robomaster competition. The infantry's main role is to attack enemy robots by launching small projectiles. This is the muzzle where the small projectiles are launched (pointing to the location). The infantry robot is highly agile and the most sensitive among all the robots. It can move in all directions. Now, let's watch it perform a "mini gyro rotation" and waist twist... (demonstration) In addition to these capabilities, the infantry robot can also perform visual recognition, such as self-targeting, which means it can automatically aim at and follow a specific object.

## Static Area
Introduction: Dog / Drone / Display Screen Playing Match Videos
Script: Take a look at this robot. What does it look like? Yes, it resembles a dog. This is one type of quadruped robot, which participated in the previous Robocon competition. And this is an aerial robot, another type of robot. After seeing so many robots, I'm sure your perception of robot forms has been refreshed. You can watch our match videos to see the functions of these robots.

## Engineering Gripper Area
Introduction: Demonstration of Engineering Gripper Picking Up Ammo Box
Script: This is the No. 2 engineering robot in the RoboMaster competition. As you can see, it has a more square shape compared to the infantry robot. Although it doesn't have a launching mechanism, it assists other robots on the field with various special mechanisms. For example, to obtain the ammo box on the resource island with ammunition worth 100 points, the engineering robot's gripping mechanism is used to collect the large projectiles, which are then supplied to the hero robot. When our infantry and other ground robots are damaged and out of the game, they often stay in the center of the field. At this time, the engineering robot can use its rescue mechanism to drag the infantry robot back to our supply area for revival. Different schools use different mechanisms to achieve actions like gripping. This vehicle uses a device called a motor for flipping and grabbing the ammo box, as well as a cylinder as the actuator to clamp the ammo box.

## Remaining RM Robots
Introduction: Sentry, Mobile Hero, and Divine Symbol
Script: Hero: (pointing to the hero robot) This robot is the hero robot. Its main role is to attack enemy robots with 35mm large projectiles (physical golf balls). This is the muzzle where the large projectiles are launched (pointing to the location). Similar to the infantry robot, the hero robot has higher damage output and slightly higher health, but lower agility and firing rate compared to the infantry robot. If we consider the infantry as a guerrilla soldier with continuous low health output, then the hero robot is a warrior with both burst damage and certain tankiness. It often organizes attacks together with the infantry robot in the competition.
Divine Symbol: Over here, you can see the rotating and glowing divine symbol. In the 20th season, it is officially called the energy mechanism. Due to its difficult activation method and the name used in previous seasons, most RM participants still refer to it as the divine symbol. The divine symbol provides high bonuses during the competition. Our infantry robot needs to activate the divine symbol in a specific way to directly increase the attack and defense power of the infantry hero. The side that activates the divine symbol first often has a significant advantage and it is an important factor in winning the game. The key algorithm required to activate the divine symbol is handled by our visual algorithm team members, who need solid knowledge in mathematics, linear algebra, probability, and logic. If you are interested in the divine symbol or mathematical logic, you can scan the QR code here to watch the visual algorithm team tutorial and learn about joining our visual algorithm team. Thank you, everyone! Now, please continue to visit the rest of the exhibition.

Sentry:
The Sentry is the only fully automated robot unit in the ROBMASTER Mech Master Competition. It is responsible for defending the base and providing cover for teammates in specific areas.
During the competition, the Sentry robot is placed on a fixed track between the base and the front line, moving along the track to seek and eliminate enemy ground robots. Although the Sentry does not have a human operator, it is equipped with one of the highest health and ammunition capacities in the competition. Additionally, its dual-barreled configuration sets it apart from other robots, giving the Sentry unparalleled firepower and making it a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield. The fact that the Sentry has won the MVP award multiple times in previous competitions further confirms its strength. Despite being the smallest and lightest robot in the competition, it is a formidable force on the field.
However, achieving such a powerful unit is no small challenge. The members of the mechanical team need to consider how to integrate a considerable number of systems into such a small volume, ensuring that they function properly without interfering with each other. The members of the electrical control team need to plan the optimal motion scheme, allowing the Sentry to move freely on its narrow track. The members of the vision team need to design an automatic targeting program, enabling the Sentry to hit its targets accurately even without human operation. So, do you want to take on this challenging and fun project?
