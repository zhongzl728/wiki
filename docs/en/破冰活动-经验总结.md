# Ice-breaking Activity - Summary of Experience

## Problems Encountered

1. Unclear formulation of rules, insufficient testing of game process, and lack of seriousness, resulting in on-the-spot rule modifications.
2. Late receipt of supplies and lack of dedicated management personnel.
3. Late arrangement of staff and assignment of tasks.
4. Staff members are not clear about the rules or not fulfilling their responsibilities, lacking team awareness and time management.
5. Some game rules are too complicated, leading to a low atmosphere.
6. The photographer was not trained, and the group photo failed to include everyone. The quality of event filming/photography was poor.
7. No designated decision-maker was responsible for handling unexpected situations.
8. Props were not prepared before the start of the activity.
9. The rules had to be repeated for each group participating in the activity.
10. The overall scoring personnel were missing.
11. After the activity, there were many discarded printouts on the venue, but the trash bags were actually nearby.
12. The dinner serving order was incorrect, giving the impression of insufficient food quantity.

## How to Improve

### Two Weeks in Advance

At least two weeks in advance, gather the staff for a planning meeting to discuss the following:

- Refer to previous materials to formulate the overall process of the activity, initial game rules, and scoring rules (as simple and understandable as possible).
- Borrowing/purchasing supplies (prepare some snacks at the activity booth to prevent hunger).
- Assign staff responsibilities, determine the overall person in charge of the activity, supply management personnel, and overall scoring personnel, with clear reward and punishment systems.
- Contingency plans for different situations (rainy days, preparation of medicine).

### One Week in Advance

- Test the game rules (not just once).
- Check and supplement supplies.

### One Day in Advance

- Packaging of gifts.
- Prepare background music for the activity (games, award ceremonies, etc.).
- Announce the rules (staff members only answer rule-related questions).
- Set up the photo-taking position, familiarize yourself with the lighting conditions at the venue, and prepare extra camera batteries.
- Arrange the venue props that can be set up in advance.

### During the Ice-breaking Activity

- Emphasize the start time and start on time, without delaying most people's time due to latecomers.
- Staff members:
  - Must be responsible and fulfill their duties without leaving their posts without authorization.
  - After completing their own tasks, they can help other positions.

### After the Ice-breaking Activity

- Organize the cleaning of the venue.
- Count the supplies and move them back to the laboratory.

### Dinner Gathering

- Serve desserts/salads first during dinner, during which everyone can introduce themselves.
- Don't just have one bottle of cola for drinks, it's best to have cola + orange juice.
- Serve the main course first (to satisfy hunger), and alternate between meat and vegetables when serving dishes.
