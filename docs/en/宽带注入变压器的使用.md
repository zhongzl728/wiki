# Using Broadband Injection Transformers ðŸš§

Broadband injection transformers are used to inject signals into circuits, such as control loops for switch-mode power supplies, in conjunction with a loop analyzer to perform loop analysis on switch-mode power supplies. This article elaborates on the use of CYBERTEK's broadband injection transformer CK100 (2Hz-2MHz).

The basic specifications of the broadband injection transformer CK100 are as follows:

| Parameter                     | Specification      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Turns Ratio                   | 1:1                |
| Bandwidth (-3dB)              | 2Hzâ€”2MHz           |
| Isolation Voltage             | 600V CATIII        |
| Primary-Secondary Capacitance | 400pF @ 1kHz       |
| Maximum Secondary Current     | 10mA               |
| Operating Range               | 0Â°C to 50â€‰Â°C       |
| Dimensions                    | 85mm Ã— 46mm Ã— 30mm |
