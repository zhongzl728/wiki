## II. Event Day Schedule

### Morning: Preparation and Testing

To address any issues with the teams adapting to the new environment, we have planned to provide time for all participating teams to prepare and fine-tune their robots upon arrival at the competition venue. The referee panel will also conduct tests on the shared equipment.

### Noon: Lunch and Rest

At noon, we plan to have lunch at the Second Cafeteria. To prevent large gatherings, we will divide everyone into three batches for meals, with the following schedule:

- **First Batch**: 11:30
- **Second Batch**: 11:50
- **Third Batch**: 12:00

After finishing lunch, we have scheduled a rest period from 12:30 to 13:30. For those not interested in resting, you can join our staff for a school and laboratory tour.

### Afternoon: Official Competition

We plan to commence the official competition at 14:30 in the afternoon. Half an hour before the competition begins, the referee panel will conduct a robot inspection for all participating teams to simulate the official competition process.

The competition will conclude at 5:00 in the afternoon. We will then proceed with exchange activities, gift exchanges, and WeChat connections.

### Evening: Exchange Activities

We have tentatively scheduled the competition to end at 17:00 on the same day. After the competition, all participating teams will engage in an exchange session. We will facilitate friendly and in-depth interactions, gift exchanges, and a group photo.

Following the exchange activities, we will arrange transportation within the campus to safely take all participating teams back home, marking the successful conclusion of our day of exchange.
