# Installing Library Files in Altium Designer

1. Copy all the library files to the corresponding **Shared\Library** folder in the software.

2. Open Altium Designer, go to the **Components** panel on the right-hand side. Click on the icon with three horizontal bars in the upper right corner, and select **File-based Library Preferences**. Then, navigate to the **Installed** tab and click the **Install** button to install the respective library files.

3. In some special cases:

   - For the Jialichuang Integrated Library, the path is located within the **JLCSMT_LIB\Project Outputs for Miscellaneous Devices LC** folder.

   - If the third-party library files are in the form of **Schematic Libraries (SchLib)** or **PCB Libraries (PcbLib)** rather than **Integrated Libraries (.IntLib)**, you will need to install both of these files simultaneously. To do this, when the library installation window pops up, click the dropdown menu on the right-hand side and select the **All Files (*.*)** wildcard. Otherwise, you will only see the **.Intlib** formatted files.
