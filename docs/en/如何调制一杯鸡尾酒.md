## Types of Base Spirits

The base spirit plays a dominant role in cocktail mixing. There are generally six types of base spirits: **Vodka**, **Whiskey**, **Rum**, **Gin**, **Brandy**, and **Tequila**.

### Vodka

Vodka is made by distilling and purifying ethanol with water. It is usually distilled three times to achieve a purer taste. During the distillation process, potatoes, syrup, rye, or wheat may be added, along with a moderate amount of flavorings. The alcohol content of vodka is typically between 35% and 50%, with 40% being the standard for traditional vodka. Vodka is known for its versatility and can be paired with various ingredients to create different flavors.

### Whiskey

Whiskey is considered a type of spirits (as mentioned in the lyrics of "Hotel California" - "We haven't had that spirit here since 1969"). Whiskey produced in Scotland and Canada is spelled as "Whisky," while whiskey produced in the United States and Ireland is spelled as "Whiskey." It can be divided into several types:

- Scotch Whisky: Produced in Scotland, traditional methods involve adding coal ash during the production process.
- Bourbon Whiskey: Made using corn syrup (slightly sweet), its production method is similar to making sourdough bread, with some de-alcoholized beer added during fermentation.
- Irish Whiskey: Produced in Ireland, the birthplace of whiskey, it is said to have been originally made using distillation techniques passed down from monasteries to the general public.

### Rum

Rum is made by fermenting and distilling by-products of sugarcane, such as sugarcane juice or molasses. The distillate is a clear liquid, and traditional methods involve aging it in oak barrels. Rum originated from the ancient process of refining sugarcane, where sugarcane juice was heated to evaporate the water and crystallize the sugar, leaving behind a residue that could not be further heated (carbonized) and was made into caramel. However, the New England colonists discovered that it could be used for brewing, giving birth to rum. Modern rum production has added a maturation period to cater to modern tastes, resulting in a smoother and more caramel-flavored rum.

An interesting fact is that rum has deep connections with the British Royal Navy and pirates during the Age of Exploration. It was even used as a form of currency during the Triangular Trade.

### Gin

Gin, also known as juniper-flavored spirit, is primarily flavored with juniper berries. It originated in the Netherlands and was initially used as medicine rather than a casual beverage. It is a neutral spirit made from grains and infused with various botanicals and spices, with juniper berries being the main ingredient.

### Brandy

Brandy, commonly known as "洋酒" in Chinese, is distilled wine. One liter of brandy usually requires the concentration of eight liters of wine. Common classifications include VS (aged for at least three years), VSOP (aged for at least four years), Napoleon (aged for at least six years), XO (aged for at least ten years), and Extra (aged for at least fifteen years). Of course, good brandy is best enjoyed on its own, and using it in cocktails would be a waste.

### Tequila

Tequila is known as the "soul of Mexico" and is a strong liquor made from the agave plant. It originated from the indigenous civilizations in Central America, who fermented the sweet and juicy agave to make alcohol. Later, Spanish colonizers improved the alcohol content through distillation, gradually replacing the fermentation method.
