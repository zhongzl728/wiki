## Uses of Capacitors

### Filtering

To remove noise. Large capacitors filter low frequencies, while small capacitors filter high frequencies.

### Decoupling / Bypassing

Simply put, bypass capacitors are placed near the power supply, while decoupling capacitors are placed near the chip.

The purpose of decoupling/bypass capacitors is to bypass high-frequency noise in the system to GND. Typically, a small-value capacitor (typically 0.1uF) is connected in parallel between the power supply pin and GND to filter out high-frequency noise and ensure a stable and clean voltage.

The difference between decoupling and bypass capacitors is that decoupling capacitors are used to filter out interference in output signals (such as the output pin of a voltage regulator), while bypass capacitors are used to filter out interference in input signals (such as the power supply pin of a microcontroller). Decoupling capacitors are generally larger (above 10uF), while bypass capacitors are selected based on the resonance frequency (0.1/0.01uF).

### Tuning

Tuning capacitors are used to adjust the frequency of an oscillating circuit to resonate with another circuit that is already oscillating.

### Coupling

The purpose of coupling capacitors is to block DC and allow AC to pass through. The capacitor, together with the load connected to it, forms a filter that filters out low-frequency signals and retains high-frequency signals, creating a high-pass filter.

Coupling capacitors are used to connect two circuits and only allow AC signals to pass through by charging and discharging the capacitor, transmitting the signal to the next stage of the circuit.

### Energy Storage

Energy storage capacitors are used to collect and store charges for later use.

## Considerations for Choosing Capacitors

Pay attention to the voltage rating, and do not reverse the polarity of polarized capacitors.
