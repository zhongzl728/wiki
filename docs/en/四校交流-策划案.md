- **3v3**: Last Stand or Attack and Defense
- **2v2**: Last Stand or Attack and Defense
- **1v1**: Last Stand or Attack and Defense
- **Timed Objectives**: [To be Edited]

![Racing Route](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/20210324151137.png)

Preparation Materials:

- Rubber Sheets (2 x 2) used as checkpoints (corners)
- Buffering at the finish line
- Finish line after more than half the blind path

### Procedure

- Two minutes of preparation time
  - Same as official competition
  - Initial loading of ammunition
- Five minutes of competition time
  - **Last Stand** or **Attack and Defense**
  - Infantry resurrects in place after 5 seconds and needs to retreat to the supply area to recover health and skills
  - Heroes resurrect in place after 10 seconds and need to retreat to the supply area to recover health and skills
    - Since the server cannot directly restore the robots, the server needs to reset the robots and then give experience points to recover them.
    - Robots maintain their level, performance points, and experience points from before their death, and their health is restored to 20% of their maximum health. Robots gain a 100% defense bonus for 10 seconds after revival.
  - Victory Conditions
    1. Defeating the opponent's base
    2. Higher remaining base health percentage
    3. In case of equal percentages, the side with higher damage wins
- Two minutes of rest and preparation time
  - Clean the arena
  - Reset obstacles
  - Clear projectiles
  - Robots return to the supply area
  - Robots unload projectiles

### Ammunition Load

![Ammunition Load](https://media.wiki-power.com/img/20210324150850.png)

In a single game, Sentry robots have 500 rounds of 17mm ammunition.

### Upgrade Mechanism

**Responsibilities:**

Sure, here is the text translated into English:

1. Inspection of Robot Size and Mechanical Structure Strength:
   - Use electrical tape on the floor to create three projected rectangles (length x width) for measuring the size (Infantry, Hero, Scout). Measure the height with a tape measure and wooden markers.
   - Test the structural strength by letting the robot free-fall from a height of 20cm and check if the structure remains intact.
2. Armor Plate Inspection (Magic Wand):
   - Use a magic wand to strike the armor plates and check for any damage.
3. Testing for Normal Restrictions on Firing Rate and Heat:
   - Provide the robot with some bullets and use a cloth bag to collect fired projectiles to check if the robot's firing rate and heat are within normal limits.
4. Projectile Collection and Obstacle Reset:
   - After a match, clean and collect projectiles on the field (broom and dustpan).
   - Reset the positions of random obstacle blocks.
5. Projectile Cleaning:
   - Clean the collected projectiles (dry cleaning) to remove surface dust and debris.
6. Projectile Packaging:
   - Package the cleaned projectiles in sets of 50 rounds each using three prepared containers: collection container, cleaning container, and packaging container.
7. Supply Station:
   - Manual supply station: Carry packaged ammunition to the supply area and provide ammunition to robots requesting it.
8. Server:
   - Configure and maintain the server, guide operators in connecting to the server, ensure the server's proper functioning, and use it for managing the competition, including health restoration and resurrection.
9. Field Referee + Robot Referee System Setup + Base Health Restoration:
   - Field referee: Enforce warnings and penalties on robots based on the competition rules, maintain order at the venue, and inform server administrators of any penalties for robots.
   - Setup of the referee system: Make necessary adjustments to the referee system on robots in special situations. When the server cannot operate normally, choose the offline mode for robots.
   - Base health restoration: Similarly, manually restore the health of offline bases.
10. Management of Various Entrances and Exits:
    - Manage the entry and exit of personnel at various points, and intercept individuals without proper identification.
