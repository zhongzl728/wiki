# THE Hack 2019 Hackathon

## Introduction

THE Hack 2019 Hackathon was held at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. My friends and I participated in this competition and after 36 hours of challenging ideation, we finally achieved the 8th place overall and received the Ruff Award.

## Project Journey

This year's competition had different topics, and initially, we chose the direction of smart homes, intending to create a smart home kit for dormitories. However, we eventually decided to focus on the topic of **how to enable disadvantaged groups in technology to enjoy the benefits of technology**. With a team consisting of a product manager and a designer, our perspective broadened this year. We not only considered the technical aspects but also took into account psychology and user needs, analyzing the topic and thinking about what the judges and sponsors value the most.

Our project this year was called AIO - Care, a smart elderly care platform based on an active learning model. I was responsible for the hardware implementation, collecting data through sensor linkage for the server to analyze and provide a more comfortable home care experience for the elderly.

The product concept and direction were led by Amihua Lau and Ada, who served as product managers. They did a great job in this aspect. In addition, Amihua Lau was also responsible for the machine learning algorithms and creating the presentation slides. Ada, as the Human Resource, provided us with a lot of help and advice (which directly determined the direction of our product) and also provided us with countless snacks and drinks, offering strong logistical support. Their contributions were beyond my reach, and they truly deserved to be the leaders of our team. Additionally, I would like to thank Yi Lin Weng from the neighboring team for creating a 3D model of our product.

I was responsible for the simple implementation of the hardware, and the code has been open-sourced on [GitHub](https://github.com/linyuxuanlin/Project-of-THE-Hack). It is based on Arduino and is a simple demo, so I won't go into detail.

Compared to the competition two years ago, where we only focused on the technical aspects, this time we developed a complete business model and profit model. We learned about the strategies of this type of competition and gained a lot of experience from excellent team projects. This is just the beginning, and I believe that in next year's Hackathon, we will achieve even better results.

In this type of competition, the direction of human care is always highly valued. From the perspective of sponsors, it is always more important than the level of technology. In the 36-hour competition, we could only develop a simple demo in terms of technology. It is the rendering and packaging of the product that can truly stand out. By presenting the creativity and concept of the product to the sponsors, this is the key to winning awards in this type of competition.
